Okay, here is the revised AWS architecture plan, tailored for your specific low-usage personal scenario while incorporating Lambda Container Images to demonstrate Docker knowledge effectively and keep costs minimal.

Revised AWS Architecture Plan for Google Calendar Application (v3)
Optimized for Ultra-Low Cost Personal Use & Docker Skill Demonstration

This document outlines an enhanced serverless-first architecture optimized for deploying the Google Calendar application to AWS for personal, intermittent use (approx. 10-30 hours/month). It prioritizes minimal cost by leveraging AWS Free Tiers and demonstrates Docker proficiency through the use of Lambda Container Images.

(Diagram Note: Real-time components (WebSocket API, Notification Lambda, DynamoDB Streams) are optional if strict real-time isn't essential for personal use, further reducing complexity and potential cost.)

Architecture Components (Optimized for Minimal Cost & Docker Demo)
1. Frontend Hosting (Estimated Monthly Cost: $1-3+)

S3 Bucket: Stores static web assets (React/Next.js build output).

Cost Optimization: Standard tier, Asset compression (gzip/brotli). Lifecycle policies likely unnecessary at this scale but good practice.

Primary Cost Driver: This and CloudFront data transfer are likely the only significant recurring costs.

2. Content Delivery & Security Edge (Estimated Monthly Cost: Minimal ~$1 + WAF)

CloudFront: CDN for caching and low-latency delivery.

Cost Optimization: High cache TTLs, Compression, Price Class 100 (US, Canada, Europe) likely sufficient.

AWS WAF: Basic protection against common exploits.

Cost: Minimal base cost + low request cost given usage.

3. API Layer (Estimated Monthly Cost: ~$0)

API Gateway (HTTP API Recommended): For standard API requests.

Cost Optimization: HTTP API is strongly recommended over REST API due to significantly lower cost per request and generous free tier. Perfect for simple Lambda proxy integrations.

Free Tier: 1 million requests/month free for the first 12 months, extremely cheap afterwards. Your usage will generate negligible requests. Expected Cost: ~$0.

API Gateway (WebSocket - Optional): Only implement if real-time push is critical for personal use. Can often be replaced by periodic polling for this scale.

Cost: Free tier applies, but connection minutes add up if left open. Expected cost likely ~$0 if used sparingly or omitted.

4. Compute Layer (Estimated Monthly Cost: ~$0)

AWS Lambda (Deployed via Container Images): Event-driven compute.

Docker Demonstration: Functions will be packaged as Docker container images. You will write Dockerfiles, build images, push them to AWS ECR, and configure Lambda to deploy from ECR. This directly showcases Docker skills within an AWS serverless context.

Cost Optimization:

Free Tier: With only 10-30 hours/month of user interaction, total Lambda execution time will be extremely low, well within the perpetual free tier (1 million requests/month, 400,000 GB-seconds/month). Expected Cost: ~$0.

Architecture: Use ARM/Graviton2 for better performance/cost.

Right-sizing: Minimal memory (e.g., 128MB or 256MB) likely sufficient.

AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry): Stores Lambda Docker images.

Docker Demonstration: Central to the container workflow.

Cost Optimization: Perpetual free tier includes 500MB/month storage for private repositories (ample for several Lambda images). Expected Cost: ~$0.

5. Database Layer (Estimated Monthly Cost: ~$0)

DynamoDB: NoSQL database.

Cost Optimization:

On-Demand Capacity: Perfect for infrequent, unpredictable personal use.

Free Tier: Perpetual free tier includes 25 GB storage, 25 WCUs, 25 RCUs capacity (when using provisioned) or equivalent on-demand request units. Your usage will almost certainly stay within these limits. Expected Cost: ~$0.

TTL: Use TTL on SessionsTable for automatic cleanup.

Real-Time Support (Optional): DynamoDB Streams can be enabled if needed for real-time updates via the optional Notification Lambda, likely staying within free tier limits.

6. Authentication (Estimated Monthly Cost: $0)

Cognito User Pool: Managed user authentication.

Cost Optimization: Free for the first 50,000 MAUs. Expected Cost: $0.

7. Security & Monitoring

IAM: Least privilege roles for all resources.

AWS WAF: Basic web protection.

Secrets Manager: Securely store external API keys (~$0.40/secret/month + negligible API cost).

CloudWatch: Monitoring & Logging. Free tier includes 5GB log storage, basic metrics, and alarms. Expected Cost: ~$0.

8. External Services (External Costs Apply)

OpenAI API / Google Calendar API: Costs depend entirely on your usage of these external services and are separate from AWS infrastructure costs. Use sparingly to minimize expense.

Demonstrating Docker Knowledge

This architecture explicitly demonstrates Docker proficiency by:

Writing Dockerfiles: Creating optimized Dockerfiles for your Lambda functions (e.g., Python, Node.js base images).

Building Container Images: Using docker build locally or via CI/CD.

Using a Container Registry: Pushing tagged images to AWS ECR.

Deploying Containers on AWS: Configuring Lambda functions to source their code from container images stored in ECR.

Local Development Environment

The local setup remains similar, focusing on emulating Lambda and API Gateway, but adds container build steps:

Tools: AWS SAM CLI (recommended for Lambda container builds) or Serverless Framework, Docker Desktop, DynamoDB Local.

Workflow:

Write Lambda code and associated Dockerfile.

Build the container image locally (sam build --use-container or docker build).

Use sam local start-api or serverless offline which can invoke Lambda functions (potentially running the local container image depending on setup).

Configure functions to talk to DynamoDB Local.

Use mock authentication middleware.

Run frontend dev server.

Deployment Plan

Simplified for personal use, focusing on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via AWS SAM or AWS CDK.

IaC Setup: Define all resources (S3, CloudFront, HTTP API Gateway, ECR Repos, Lambda functions referencing ECR images, DynamoDB tables, Cognito) in SAM/CDK templates.

Build & Push Images: Script the Docker build and ECR push process.

Deploy: Use sam deploy or cdk deploy to provision/update the AWS resources.

CI/CD (Optional but Recommended): Set up a simple pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to build/push images and deploy on code changes.

Revised Estimated Total Monthly Cost (Personal Use)

Leveraging perpetual free tiers for core services:

Lambda: ~$0 (Free Tier)

API Gateway (HTTP API): ~$0 (Free Tier / Low Cost Tier)

DynamoDB: ~$0 (Free Tier)

ECR: ~$0 (Free Tier)

Cognito: $0 (Free Tier)

CloudWatch: ~$0 (Free Tier)

S3 + CloudFront: $1 - $3+ (Primary cost driver - storage & data transfer)

WAF: ~$1+ (Minimal base/request costs)

Secrets Manager: ~$0.40 per secret

Data Transfer: Minimal, likely covered by other service costs/tiers.

Total Estimated AWS Cost: ~$1 - $5 per month (Dominated by S3/CloudFront/WAF/Secrets)
(Excludes external API costs like OpenAI or Google API usage fees)

This architecture provides an extremely cost-effective way to host your personal application while effectively demonstrating sought-after skills in both AWS serverless technologies and Docker containerization.
